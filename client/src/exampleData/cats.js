She will greet known people for fuss with a happy tail and sweet chirrups. Our girl wants nothing more than to laze the days away on her favourite persons lap, enjoying lots of fuss. Nelly will need some access to a garden to stretch her legs out in the warmer weather."},

When playing with his toys he throws himself around after them with seemingly boundless energy, then settles down for a cosy nap curled up on his blankets! Cheese Toastie will need cat flap access to a garden so he can expend his excess energy when the mood strikes and feel the sun on his fur!"}
